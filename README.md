# Phillips-Curve-and-Okun-s-Law-Analysis

The aim of our project is to establish the relationship between inflation and unemployment (the Phillips curve) & GDP and Unemployment (Okun's Law) in Japan & USA. We'll rely on the time series data that we have to examine the interconnectedness between general inflation rates, unemployment rates and GDP .

Conducted a comparative analysis of 60 years of quarterly historical data from the United States and Japan, utilizing machine learning and statistical methods to explore key economic dynamics.

Examined the Phillips Curve and Okunâ€™s Law using linear regression models in scikit-learn, with results visualized through matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.

Analyzed over 250 variables, uncovering macroeconomic relationships and providing insights into inflation-unemployment trade-offs and the link between unemployment and GDP growth in both countries.

Data Collected through FED API.
